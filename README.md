# Chudnovsky Algorithm for Calculating Pi

This program calculates the value of Pi using the [Chudnovsky algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chudnovsky_algorithm),
an extremely fast method to calculate the digits of π. It was published by the Chudnovsky brothers in 1988.

## Prerequisites

The program requires two libraries:

1. **Boost:** A set of peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries that extend the functionality of C++. You can download it from [here](https://www.boost.org/users/download/). 
2. **MPFR:** A library for multiple-precision floating-point computations with correct rounding. You can download it from [here](http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/#download).

Make sure to install these libraries before compiling and running the program. Both packages are also available on [brew.sh](https://brew.sh).

These libraries are used for the high precision computation required to compute many digits of π.

## How To Compile The Program?
You need a compiler that supports C++20 standard because this code uses features introduced in this version.
Here is an example compile line: `c++ -std=c++20 -O3 -o chudnovsky chudnovsky.cpp -L/usr/local/opt/mpfr/lib/ -lmpfr`
This was used on my i9 MacBook Pro.

On an M2 Mac mini, I used the following line: `c++ -std=c++20 -O3 -I /opt/homebrew/include -L /opt/homebrew/lib -o chudnovsky chudnovsky.cpp -lmpfr`

This is because HomeBrew installs packages on Intel based Macs differently than M* based Macs. Or perhaps it is because of
Big Sur. Whatever. Who cares? It's different and it's annoying!

## Usage
To run the program, you should pass one argument which is the number of terms to be computed in the series.
Usage example: `./chudnovsky 10` 

It will compute Pi up to 10 terms. Don't confuse terms for digits. You will get many more digits
for each term. Term refers to the series used. Each term produces aproximately 14 decimal digits.

The output will display Pi computed up to `n` terms (where `n` was your input) and then print out a calculated approximation of Pi.

## Algorithm Explanation
The Chudnovsky algorithm calculates 1/π as:

![12 Σ ((-1)^k * (6k)! * (545140134k + 13591409)) / ((3k)!(k!)^3 * (640320)^(3k+3/2))](https://github.com/Fudmottin/Chudnovsky/blob/main/chudnovsky.svg)

## Note

Remember that the more terms you use, the more accurate your calculation will be, but it will also take longer to compute. For instance, using 10 terms provides a very accurate approximation of Pi.

This program is a great way to understand how numerical methods work and how C++ can be used for scientific computing tasks. Feel free to experiment with it and optimize it as needed!

## Addendum

```
Pi-1000000.txt
pi-diff.sh
```

These files are for testing the output for correctness. The Pi-1000000.txt file is
the first million digits of π in a single line of text. The shell script is intended
to compare the output of chudnovsky to the canonical π text to see where disagreement
begins.

```

As you can see, there is a point where the digits are start to be just plain wrong.
that's just the nature of this implementation. If you follow the link to the wikipedia
page, you will see that there is more room for optimization. This implementation is
parallelized using std::future<mpfr_float>.
